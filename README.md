I am trying to study with an "Overview of Data Tools and Languages"
but I have an issue that is not mentionned anywhere. We all fake not to know that our DNA, in its purest conception generates the code that flows in our blood, and get transmitted to machines. That vital aspect of growth, development, correction, and conception is not mentionned anywhere in its biology, rather then in its metaphysics narrative equivoque and ambiguous for a lack of knowledge to a public vulgarization.
